### Briefly About Myself:
I am 38 years old, I started my acquaintance with programming when I was studying to be a mechanical engineer in 2001, then I became interested in programming, since then I have been tracking different areas of innovation, but it was at the level of a hobby.<br>

After graduating from the institute in 2006. and got a job as an engineer at one of the mining enterprises of our city. I began to apply my knowledge in programming for partial automation and templates, and in 2014 I became the head of the contract bureau.<br>

In 2021, I made decisions to start a new career in IT.<br>

I am sure that my previous experience and focus will help me go through this path and I will become an experienced developer, as my motto is "A difficult task is not a reason to give up, but a good chance to improve your skills".<br>

### CodeWars (Code example):

![CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/svoboda-core/badges/large)

**Find the unique number KATA from CODEWARS:**
*John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns. ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]. John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more than t = 174 miles and he will visit only 3 towns.
Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please Mary and John?*
JavaScript:
```javascript
function chooseBestSum(t, k, arr) {
    return arr
    .reduce((r, e) => r.concat(r.filter(c => c.length < k).map(c => c.concat([e]))),[[]])
    .filter(c => c.length === k)
    .map(c => c.reduce((a, b) => a + b))
    .filter(s => s <= t)
    .sort((a, b) => b - a)[0] || null;
}
```
*Write a python function that sorts a list.The list can be string or numbers; the rest is up to you! Focus on simplicity and readability rather than efficiency.
Python:
```Python 
is_inputs_1 = ["apple", "banana", "grapes", "fat", ":)", 1, 2, 25, 5, 10, -1, -5, 0, 0.10, -0.15,[], {"user": "Vasily"}]
is_inputs_2 = [{"user": "Vasily"}, {"user": "Elen"}]

def sorted_list(inputs) -> list:
    is_namber = []
    is_str = []
    [is_namber.append(input) for input in inputs if type(input) == int or type(input) == float]
    [is_str.append(input) for input in inputs if type(input) == str]
    joinedList = [y for x in [sorted(is_namber), sorted(is_str)] for y in x]
    if len(joinedList) > 0:
        print(joinedList)
    else:
        print("List not contain str or numbers")

sorted_list(is_inputs_1)
sorted_list(is_inputs_2)
```
