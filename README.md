### Briefly About Myself:
I am 38 years old, I started my acquaintance with programming when I was studying to be a mechanical engineer in 2001, then I was interested in programming since then I tracked different tendencies of innovation but it was at the level of a hobby.<br>

After graduating from the institute in 2006. and getting a job as an engineer in one of the mining enterprises of our city. I began to apply my knowledge in programming for partial automation and templating, and so in 2014 I became the head of the contract work bureau.<br>

But having achieved certain achievements, I began to lack the drive to learn new things at the beginning of 2021. I quit my business and start looking for my direction in programming, I tried Java, Python and settled on Frontend Developer.<br>

I am interested in web development, because you immediately see the result of your work in the browser. Programming provides endless opportunities for professional growth and endless drive to learn new things.<br>

I believe that my experience and dedication to this goal will help me go this way, and I will become an experienced Frontend developer.<br>
